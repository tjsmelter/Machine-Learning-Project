## End to End Machine Learning Project

This is a project I created in conjunction with a YouTube series provided by Krish Naik (https://www.youtube.com/@krishnaik06). Through this series, I learned how to create a machine learning program from the initial environment, pipelines, and logging setup to model training and testing.
